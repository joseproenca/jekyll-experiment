## Journal Special Issue
A selection of papers from the accepted submissions are planned to be invited to submit an extended journal version. In these days, we are working to organize the special issue. Invited speakers are also welcome to submit a contribution related to the talk they will deliver. 

## Awards
The organizers will select a shortlist of PC members for a sub-committee aimed at evaluating the Best Paper Award and the Best Presentation Award of FACS (for presentations from the open call for papers).
